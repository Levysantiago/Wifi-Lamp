## About
This project is a personal project that worked with me and I wanted to share with the comunity. The idea is to turn on or off a lamp (of your bedroom, your living room...) by Wifi, that is, you don't need to get up of your bed to click the interruptor, you just take your phone, access the page which is responsable by your lamp and click to turn on or off. That's it. It's a great experience, my advice is to download this code, buy the wemos board, try to use it, make your changes, after try to think in something bigger and implement it. This is a good way to get more experience and learn more about these boards and other components.

### Project Status

The project status is "In Development". I'm having another ideas and I'm still making changes and testing.
